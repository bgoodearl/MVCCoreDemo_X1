# ASP.NET Core 3.1 MVC web application with Azure AD Authentication

## Initial Project Setup

When first setting up the project, look at
`_ConfigSource\MVCDemo\appsettings.user_xxxx.json`

You can either copy it to the MVCDemo folder and rename it so "xxxx"
is the the username for development, or merge its contents with
appsettings.json or put it in with app secrets.
